A project for a device that helps achieve lucid dreams using light signals and selected music played during the REM phase of sleep. The device uses an ESP32 Lite board with built-in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and the ability to connect a battery and charge it. Detection of the REM phase is done using infrared reflective sensors. RGB LEDs are used for light signals, and a connected phone is used to play music. Settings and statistics will be available in an app on the phone that connects via Bluetooth.
